## Hi, my name is Jesús Petit 👋

A passionate self-taught programmer, currently immersed in my Computer Science studies at the University of Carabobo. Since my early years, I have felt a deep connection with the world of video games and the wonder of the internet. Curiosity has always driven me to wonder what is hidden behind each web page and how that video game that captures my attention works.

My journey into web development started around 2007, when I was just 11 years old. Back then, I immersed myself in the fascinating world of creating websites using tools like Macromedia Fireworks and Macromedia Dreamweaver. From that point, my fascination with programming and web design has only grown.

Starting in early 2022, I have been intensely focused on expanding my knowledge. I have explored various programming languages, frameworks, distributed version control systems and web design, constantly seeking to improve my skills and understand the complexities of technological development.

My academic career includes obtaining a degree in Modern Languages ​​with a specialization in business. This achievement has been a springboard for my next goal, which is intrinsically linked to technology from its roots. Every step I take brings me closer to realizing my passion for programming and constantly discovering new possibilities in the vast digital world.

## Some of the technologies i've studied and working with until now:
